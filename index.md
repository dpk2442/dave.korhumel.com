Hello and welcome! My name is Dave Korhumel, and I am currently employed as a
software engineer by Microsoft in Redmond, WA. I have a Bachelor's Degree in
computer science from Rochester Institute of Technology, in Rochester, NY. When
I have free time, I enjoy working on side projects, almost all of which are on
GitHub, and many of which can be found on the Projects page.
