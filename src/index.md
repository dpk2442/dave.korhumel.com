Hello and welcome! My name is Dave Korhumel, and I am currently a software
engineer at Microsoft in Redmond, WA. I have a Bachelor's Degree in computer
science from Rochester Institute of Technology, in Rochester, NY. When I have
free time, I enjoy working on side projects, almost all of which are on GitHub,
and many of which can be found on the Projects page.
